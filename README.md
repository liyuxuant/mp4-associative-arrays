Associative Arrays
==================
//Tony Li
//MP4:
Add at least three tests, including one edge case, to the shared AssociativeArrayTests.java repository. 
Implement an AssociativeArray<K,V> class in Java. You may not use any other Java classes that provide similar features; you must rely on an underlying plain Java array of KVPair<K,V> objects.

//The revised version passed all the test, refactored all the repeated code, handeled null key in get and has key, and fixed the indentation.
